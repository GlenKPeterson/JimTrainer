![Learn UncleJim with JimTrainer](LearnUncleJim.jpg)

A set of exercises for learning functional programming with [UncleJim](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/UncleJim) in Java.

#Requirements:
 - [Java 8 SE Development Kit (JDK8)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/).  It doesn't have to be the Oracle version.  It can be OpenJDK8+ or simmilar.

 - [Maven 3.2+](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

 - A text editor or IDE

 - Download [UncleJim](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/UncleJim) and run `mvn clean install` on it.  Hopefully it will be in Sonatype / Maven Central soon to eliminate this step.

#Usage 
 - Run `mvn clean test` on this project (JimTrainer)
 
 - Uncomment [unit tests](src/test/java) and make them pass.  Start with Easy, then progress.
